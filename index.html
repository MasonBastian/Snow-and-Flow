      <h2>The Origins of Snowboarding</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Snowboarding didn’t fall from the sky — it tore down the slopes of history, a blend of imagination, rebellion and a ton of powder.</p>
        <p>It began in 1965, when a Michigan man named Sherman Poppen strapped together two skis to create a toy for his daughter. He named it the “Snurfer” (snow + surfer). It was a front rope (for balance) and no bindings. Children loved it — and it started a new winter trend.</p>
        <p>Jump ahead to the 1970s and 80s, pioneers such as Jake Burton Carpenter, Tom Sims, and Dimitrije Milovich began fashioning boards with better control, steel edges and bindings. Burton, in particular, propelled snowboarding into the mainstream — even as many ski resorts prohibited it.</p>
        <p>By the ’90s, snowboarding was a sensation. Tricks, terrain parks and an edgy, skate-influenced culture had established it as the winter sport of a new generation.</p>
        <p>Snowboarding made its Olympic debut in Nagano, Japan in 1998, and the rest is history.</p>
        <p>Today, from backcountry runs to halfpipe contests, snowboarding is more than a sport — it’s a lifestyle.</p>
        <p>And this blog is here to hop on that wave. Welcome to Snow & Flow. 🏂</p>

        <h3>10 Fun Facts About Snowboarding</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The first snowboard was a toy.</strong><br>In 1965, Sherman Poppen built the “Snurfer” by bolting two skis together for his daughter. That DIY vibe still lives on today.</li>
          <li><strong>Snowboarding was once banned.</strong><br>In the ‘80s, ski resorts thought snowboarders were too wild — many banned them outright. Rebels, obviously.</li>
          <li><strong>It’s been an Olympic sport since 1998.</strong><br>Snowboarding made its official Olympic debut at the Nagano Winter Games in Japan.</li>
          <li><strong>Shaun White won his first X Games medal at age 13.</strong><br>And he wasn’t even old enough to drive himself there.</li>
          <li><strong>Snowboarding has deep skateboarding roots.</strong><br>That’s why so many tricks are named after skateboarding moves — like the “method” and “mute grab.”</li>
          <li><strong>The fastest speed on a snowboard is over 125 mph.</strong><br>French snowboarder Edmond Plawczyk holds the record. Seriously… don’t try this at your local hill.</li>
          <li><strong>There’s a snowboarding video game legend: SSX Tricky.</strong><br>If you know, you know. The soundtrack alone deserves a gold medal.</li>
          <li><strong>Burton dominates the snowboard gear game.</strong><br>Founded in 1977, it helped shape the sport into what it is today.</li>
          <li><strong>Terrain parks changed everything.</strong><br>Jumps, rails, halfpipes — terrain parks turned the mountain into a playground.</li>
          <li><strong>Snowboarding is more than sport — it’s style.</strong><br>From baggy gear to board graphics, self-expression is part of the ride.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Snowboarding isn’t just about speed or tricks — it’s about freedom. That’s what Snow & Flow is all about.</p>
