      <h2>The Origins of Snowboarding</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Snowboarding didn’t fall from the sky — it tore down the slopes of history, a blend of imagination, rebellion and a ton of powder.</p>
        <p>It began in 1965, when a Michigan man named Sherman Poppen strapped together two skis to create a toy for his daughter. He named it the “Snurfer” (snow + surfer). It was a front rope (for balance) and no bindings. Children loved it — and it started a new winter trend.</p>
        <p>Jump ahead to the 1970s and 80s, pioneers such as Jake Burton Carpenter, Tom Sims, and Dimitrije Milovich began fashioning boards with better control, steel edges and bindings. Burton, in particular, propelled snowboarding into the mainstream — even as many ski resorts prohibited it.</p>
        <p>By the ’90s, snowboarding was a sensation. Tricks, terrain parks and an edgy, skate-influenced culture had established it as the winter sport of a new generation.</p>
        <p>Snowboarding made its Olympic debut in Nagano, Japan in 1998, and the rest is history.</p>
        <p>Today, from backcountry runs to halfpipe contests, snowboarding is more than a sport — it’s a lifestyle.</p>
        <p>And this blog is here to hop on that wave. Welcome to Snow & Flow. 🏂</p>
