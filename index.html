  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>The number of snowboarders has declined almost 28 percent since its peak in 2010. According to the National Ski Areas Association. In the article, <em>"Coping with Recession in the Ski-Industry: A Suppliers' and Consumers' Perspective,"</em> authors Taks, Marijke, and Jona Ragoen present how the economic cycle affects the ski industry on both the supplier and consumer sides. When the economy is in downturn or recession, interviews with suppliers in two ski resorts and ski travel agencies, as well...

        <li><strong>Look where you want to go.</strong> Your body follows your eyes — don’t stare at the ground or trees.</li>

      <h2>The Origins of Snowboarding</h2>
      <p>Snowboarding didn’t fall from the sky — it tore down the slopes of history, a blend of imagination, rebellion and a ton of powder.</p>
      <p>It began in 1965, when a Michigan man named Sherman Poppen strapped together two skis to create a toy for his daughter. He named it the “Snurfer” (snow + surfer). It was a front rope (for balance) and no bindings. Children loved it — and it started a new winter trend.</p>
      <p>Jump ahead to the 1970s and 80s, pioneers such as Jake Burton Carpenter, Tom Sims, and Dimitrije Milovich began fashioning boards with better control, steel edges and bindings. Burton, in particular, propelled snowboarding into the mainstream — even as many ski resorts prohibited it.</p>
      <p>By the ’90s, snowboarding was a sensation. Tricks, terrain parks and an edgy, skate-influenced culture had established it as the winter sport of a new generation.</p>
      <p>Snowboarding made its Olympic debut in Nagano, Japan in 1998, and the rest is history.</p>
      <p>Today, from backcountry runs to halfpipe contests, snowboarding is more than a sport — it’s a lifestyle.</p>

  <h2>10 Fun Facts About Snowboarding</h2>
  
    
    
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The first snowboard was a toy.</strong><br>In 1965, Sherman Poppen built the “Snurfer” by bolting two skis together for his daughter. That DIY vibe still lives on today.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowboarding was once banned.</strong><br>In the ‘80s, ski resorts thought snowboarders were too wild — many banned them outright. Rebels, obviously.</li>
        <li><strong>It’s been an Olympic sport since 1998.</strong><br>Snowboarding made its official Olympic debut at the Nagano Winter Games in Japan.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaun White won his first X Games medal at age 13.</strong><br>And he wasn’t even old enough to drive himself there.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowboarding has deep skateboarding roots.</strong><br>That’s why so many tricks are named after skateboarding moves — like the “method” and “mute grab.”</li>
        <li><strong>The fastest speed on a snowboard is over 125 mph.</strong><br>French snowboarder Edmond Plawczyk holds the record. Seriously… don’t try this at your local hill.</li>
        <li><strong>There’s a snowboarding video game legend: SSX Tricky.</strong><br>If you know, you know. The soundtrack alone deserves a gold medal.</li>
        <li><strong>Burton dominates the snowboard gear game.</strong><br>Founded in 1977, it helped shape the sport into what it is today.</li>
        <li><strong>Terrain parks changed everything.</strong><br>Jumps, rails, halfpipes — terrain parks turned the mountain into a playground.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowboarding is more than sport — it’s style.</strong><br>From baggy gear to board graphics, self-expression is part of the ride.</li>

  <h2>My Personal Story</h2>
  
    
    
      <p>I still can remember strapping into a snowboard for the first time. I was 13, standing on the top of a small hill at a local ski resort, wrapped in a jacket two sizes too large and a pair of big boots that made me walk funny. It felt strange beneath my feet — slick, unpredictable, wild. But as I fell for the first time — and then the second, and the third — something unexpected happened. I laughed, and I laughed hard. It was a laugh that comes only from being humbled by something you thought would come naturally.</p>
  <p>That hill was nothing compared to where snowboarding would take me.</p>
  <p>For years, I continued to snowboard in powder. Snowboarding turned from a pastime into a ritual, a reset button, a way to be fully present. I began to glimpse why this sport is so special to me. It’s not only the thrill of blasting down the slope — it’s the community, the hush of snowfall, the liberation of each run.</p>
  <p>But I have also seen how the sport has changed.</p>
  <p>Snowboarder visits in the United States declined by 28 percent, from about 8.2 million in 2010 to 5.9 million in 2016, according to the National Ski Areas Association. That stat hit me hard. I began to see fewer riders in lift lines, fewer people in terrain parks. Snowboarding is now slowly dropping out of fashion. And that’s tough to watch.</p>
  <p>The experts have their theories — perhaps it’s the cost, the competition from the resurgence of skiing, or how social media has changed perceptions of what’s “cool.” In The New York Times, Billy Witz noted that snowboarding “has lost some of its luster,” and it’s difficult to disagree. But I also believe we’ve simply forgotten how to share the soul of it.</p>
  <p>And that’s why I started Snow & Flow — a home for sharing the stories, the highs and wipeouts, the history and heart of snowboarding. Because the numbers may be down but the sensation of dropping into untracked snow, will never go out of style.</p>
