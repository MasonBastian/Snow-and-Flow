  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>The number of snowboarders has declined almost 28 percent since its peak in 2010. According to the National Ski Areas Association. In the article, <em>"Coping with Recession in the Ski-Industry: A Suppliers' and Consumers' Perspective,"</em> authors Taks, Marijke, and Jona Ragoen present how the economic cycle affects the ski industry on both the supplier and consumer sides. When the economy is in downturn or recession, interviews with suppliers in two ski resorts and ski travel agencies, as well as surveys of Flemish ski tourists, show that ski tourism also experiences a decline. The authors find that the recession's impact varies among different groups. Households without children, individuals facing money constraints, and people with lower occupational status are all more susceptible to economic hardship. The research also offers a contribution to theories concerning the socioeconomics of ski tourism and provides the supplier with development strategies for companies in times of recession. This article is of practical interest in understanding how economic factors affect participation rates in snow sports, including snowboarding.</p>
